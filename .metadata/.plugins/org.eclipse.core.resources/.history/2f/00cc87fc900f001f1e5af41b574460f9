	/** Constructor:
	 * 	constructor is similar to method but have no return type
	 * 	constructor name should be as same as class name
	 * 	constructor used to allocate memory and initialize object
	 * 
	 *  constructor types: default and parameterized constructor, default constructor will not have parameters
	 *  it will execute at the time of object creation even if we have default constructor created or not. 
	 *  if created then executes and print else it will allocate memory to the variables created in class.
	 *  we can initialize variables inside constructor if we have variables declared inside class
	 *  if default constructor created explicitly by user and it is parameterized then we should pass values inside constructor while object creation
	 *  
	 *  Constructor Overloading:
	 *  same constructor name but we have to differentiate it with parameters
	 *  Example: abcd() - default, abcd(int a, int b) - parameterized, abcd(double a, double b), abcd(int a, int b, int c)
	 *  but we have to create objects and methods as same no of constructors created to execute constructors. 
	 *  single constructor will execute only one constructor so we have to create objects irrespective of constructors created
	 *  
	 *  note:
	 *  local variable only can access inside methods, variables created inside constructor will not access inside method
	 *  parameters should be same data type either int a, int b or float a, float b, or double a, double b
	 *  methods also we have to create irrespective of no of constructors created
