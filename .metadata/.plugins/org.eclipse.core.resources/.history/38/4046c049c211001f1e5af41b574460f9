		1. This Keyword:
			*	It is used to point out current class instance variable (blue color)
			 	local variable as parameters of method (brown color)
			
			*	Example: 
				class ThisKeyword{
				int a; // instance variable
				void display(int a){ // local variable
				this a = a; // this.instance variable = local variable
				}
				}
			
			*	Note: if we have same local variable name and class variable name we should use this keyword.
				other wise no need of use this keyword.
		
		2. Final Keyword:
			*	we can use final keyword for class variable and method
			
				Variable: value is fixed and unable update it further means constant
				Method: can not be overridden
				Class: cannot be inherited
			
		3. Super Keyword:
			*	Achieved by Inheritance concept.
			* 	Used to access immediate parent class' variables, methods and constructors from child class.
			* 	Note:
				Name of both Parent class and child class variables methods should be same
				this rule automatically implies on Constructors as constructor name should be same as class name.
			
			Constructor: 
			*	constructors can be parameterized and/or default.
			*	If we explicitly mentioned super keyword in constructor it will take place in both child and parent class constructor.
			*	mainly constructor call should be in first line. example : super() should be in first line. other wise it will throw error.
		
			Methods:
			*	Method name of both parent and child should be same
			* 	line order of super is not a problem. we can put it anywhere inside method
			*   syntax: super.display()
			*	child class method execute first as we are creating object of child class. to access parent method we should use above syntax in child class method.
			
			variable:
			*	using super keyword we can access instance variable of parent class in child class
			*	syntax: super.num1
