    need to write a java program in note pad:
    public class Mini{
    	public static void main(String[] args){
    	
    		/**here main method is having array of type String in it as arguments
    		args is nothing but a variable of array type of string
    		so array index value starts from 0*/
    		
    		int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    		System.out.println(a);
    		
    		here we are converting string variable(args[0]) to int so we are using Integer class and for conversion we have method called 
    		parseInt in Integer class.
    		
    		it will convert string value into int and store the value in variable a 
    		
    	}
    }
    
    save file with extension .java
    then we have to open cmd
    cd location of the java class
    javac filename.java
    java filename value for a ----> getting user inputs in run time
